However, she had been competing in reality shows since much further back.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In fact, Seunghee competed on two singing shows in 2007, when she was only 11 years old. And during an episode of KBS’s Museum of Broken Relationships, she got candid about being on the receiving end of hate from a young age. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As time went on, the hate comments she received continued coming in and it got so bad at one point her parents felt the need to apologize.</p><h2>Oh My Girl’s Seunghee On The Receiving End Of Hate Comments</h2><p>Seunghee's first time competing on a show was in KBS1’s Korea Sings in 2007. Though she was only 11 years old at the time, she was awarded the Excellence Prize for her skills.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The same year, the Oh My Girl member appeared on SBS’s Star King. During her run, she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nicknamed</a> the 11-year-old Little BoA (BoA refers to Kwon Bo-ah who is often referred to as the queen of <a href=# rel=follow>K-pop</a>) and the moniker has stuck with her to this day as she is referred to as 2nd BoA to this day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Seunghee began receiving her first hate comments since her first appearances in the aforementioned shows. Following her first two appearances on Star King and Korea Sings, she went on to participate in the second season of Mnet’s Superstar K in 2010. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She eventually made her debut in Oh My Girl almost eight years after her first TV appearances. However, after joining the girl group, the hate comments got worse and most of them were directed at her looks.</p><p>Seunghee opened up that haters would say her face looked “crushed”. She explained that she wasn’t as hurt by the comment as she could have been, but her parents were devastated. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They took the hate comment to heart, and it got so bad that they apologized to her for the way she looked and for making her “be born this way.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While most of the hate comments just hurt her, she revealed this one, in particular, made her angry as it made her parents feel bad. However, she has found ways to navigate past the negativities and has found a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">brighter way of looking at the hate comments</a>.</p><p>They’re probably saying cruel things about my face because I have no other bad traits to comment on.</p><p>Aside from the hate comments, Seunghee has also received a great deal of love and support from her fans. Since having made her debut in Oh My Girl in 2015, she has made her acting debut and continued competing in singing competition shows such as Girl Spirit and King of Mask Singer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuVqruotMSeZKGZpJp6pLvMppynrKNjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2foh-my-girl-s-seunghee-opens-up-about-her-parents-being-sorry-for-hate-comments.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shannen-doherty-photos-of-the-actress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shannen-doherty-photos-of-the-actress.html>Shannen Doherty: Photos Of The Actress</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nick-mohammed-kids-latest-in-bollywood.html>Nick Mohammed Kids | Latest In Bollywood</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nick-mohammed-kids-latest-in-bollywood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
