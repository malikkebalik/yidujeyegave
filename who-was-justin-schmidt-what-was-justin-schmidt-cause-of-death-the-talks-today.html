Along with co-authoring the book Insect Defenses: Adaptive Mechanisms and Strategies of Prey and Predators, he was also the author of The Sting of the Wild and the creator of the Schmidt sting pain index. Schmidt’s research focused on a range of areas, including honey bee nutrition, chemical communication, physiology, ecology, and behavior. He conducted his studies at the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona, before dedicating himself entirely to The Southwestern Biological Institute in 2006. As the research director of the Southwest Biological Institute, he specialized in studying the chemical and behavioral defenses of ants, wasps, and arachnids.</p><h2 id=what_was_justin_schmidt_cause_of_death class=smooth-goto>What was Justin Schmidt cause of death?</h2><p>Justin Schmidt, a well-known entomologist and researcher from the University of Arizona, passed away on February 18, 2023, at the age of 75 due to Parkinson’s disease.
