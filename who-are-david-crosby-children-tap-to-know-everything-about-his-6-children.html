James Raymond was with Celia Crawford Ferguson in 1962. They both decided to send him for adoption, though James and his biological father were later reunited.</span></p><p><span>James is a musician and James and David performed together in the band CPR (Crosby, Pevar, & Raymond).&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Erika_Keller_Crosby_%E2%80%93_1966></span><span><strong>Erika Keller Crosby – 1966<br></strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Erika Keller Crosby was born to David Crosby and Jackie Guthrie, and she has lived a private life out of the spotlight, so her age and date of birth are not known.</span></p><p><span>However, it is known that she has 4 siblings on her mother Jackie Guthrie’s side, and their father is a folk singer Arlo Guthrie. Erika Keller Crosby has 3 kids and they live in Florida.<br></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Donovan_Crosby></span><span><strong>Donovan Crosby<br></strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>David’s 3rd child is a daughter named Donovan Crosby.
