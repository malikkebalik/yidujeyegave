Rose confirmed the shirt was hers and called her ex a “weirdo.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Having ur bitch where my clothes is crazy lol,” she wrote on Twitter, adding: “I like Halle, Ddg a weirdo tho fasho.”</p><p>Rose then posted a screenshot of an alleged DM exchange with DDG from earlier that week, in which he asked her if she was still in Los Angeles.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“U hitting me the day y’all argue is so u lol,” Rose responded, to which DDG replied: “lol u right, lemme go heal first.”</p><p>“This is why I’m single,” Rose added in her caption.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/07/ddg-halle-bailey-relationship-250x142.jpg alt="DDG Opens Up About Halle Bailey Relationship: 'I Look Up To Her'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>DDG Opens Up About Halle Bailey Relationship: 'I Look Up To Her'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>July 5, 2022</p></a><p>The drama kicked off a slew of back and forth between DDG and his former flame, with the former telling his fans on Twitter the Rose is a “demon” starved for relevancy. Halle Bailey also stood by her man, and said, “the devil is working lol please don’t feed into the lies, especially from a third party.”</p><p>As fans watched the drama unfold on Twitter, a new 30-minute vlog titled “The WORST week of my life” shows just how united Bailey and the Michigan rapper really are against Rubi Rose.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Donning a pair of crutches, DDG at one point can be seen hobbling into view as he says he’s been taking time to himself in light of “all the shenanigans going on.”</p><p>“Y’all know deep down in y’all heart know I’m a good n-gga,” DDG says near the five-minute mark. “I always been positive.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He went on to say, “Stay away from negativity man this is not 2020, I’m not dealing with that shit no more. I just don’t like when people formulate opinions about me and they don’t really know me because that could be detrimental.”</p><p>He continued, “A lot of people by wondering like damn why you always be tweeting, or why you be always responding to stuff, it’s because when you don’t people come up with this narrative in they’re head about you, and to be honest in the entertainment industry you can’t be having a bad name.”</p><p></p><p>A lot of rumors and allegations and stuff you gotta clear up just to stop yourself from taking that type of hate and having this narrative of people just hating you for nothing. They don’t know the real. Believe it or not everything you see on the internet isn’t true.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the vlog, Bailey appeared and was seen chilling on the couch.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>DDG and Halley Bailey’s relationship has been filled with drama in recent days. The former was&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>forced to address break-up rumors last week after he was called out by Bailey’s sister Sky on Instagram Live.</a></p><p>“If y’all broke up, then you need to just unfollow and keep it pushing; you don’t have to put nothing out there like that talking about ‘all these girls is the same.’ Are you dumb? Are you stupid?” Sky said during her rant.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>However, Sky later corrected herself after learning the couple was very much still together. “My bad y’all. I spoke to my sis and ain’t nothing going on lol,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories afterwards. “Let me go back to drinking my water and minding the business that pays me.”</p><p>DDG echoed Sky’s sentiments and clarified on Twitter that no one was breaking up with anyone.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“The internet is so gullible,” he wrote in one tweet, before adding: “Nobody cheated on nobody btw. don’t take my tweets too serious…n-ggas take life too serious. We all gon die at some point anyway, let’s try to have fun while we here..”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibnZ9dna6tuMRmmZqhnJrGbsLLqJ5mqqWXtm6%2BzqycZpydYrGzrcya</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fddg-halle-bailey-put-on-united-front-following-rubi-rose-drama.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jaden-sprinz-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jaden-sprinz-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Jaden Sprinz | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andy-spade-picks-up-daughter-at-school-to-deliver-news-about-kate-hollywood-life.html>Andy Spade Picks Up Daughter At School To Deliver News About Kate Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./andy-spade-picks-up-daughter-at-school-to-deliver-news-about-kate-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
