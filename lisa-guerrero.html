Over the years, she has developed knowledge and authority in the fields of journalism and sportscasting. This fame undoubtedly comes with a sizable salary. However, neither Lisa nor her employers have disclosed her annual income or any other financial information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d4/4by3/2023/01/18/d4565fb9bc964af7bedffd7b982c72d8_md.jpg><p>LISA’S NET WORTH IS APPROXIMATELY <strong>$30 MILLION</strong>. However, conducting an internet search reveals some information regarding her net worth. Lisa’s net worth, according to Wikinetworth.com, is somewhere in the neighborhood of <strong>$30 million</strong>. According to another website, Net Worth List, Lisa is worth approximately $18 million.</p><h2>Childhood, Parents, and Education</h2><p>Lisa Guerrero was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 9 April 1964. Her mother’s name is Lucy Guerrero, and her father’s name is Walter Coles, according to her Wikipedia biography. Additionally, the same article states that her father was an American of English ancestry and her mother was Chilean.</p><p>This practically means Lisa is of mixed ethnic origins, being English on her father’s side and Hispanic on her mother’s. Her family most likely relocated from Chicago to San Diego, California, where she spent the majority of her youth. Additionally, she spent some time in Huntington Beach, California. She had to endure the loss of her mother early in her childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Guerreros-Father-252x300.jpg><p>Lisa was just eight years old when her mother, Lucy, passed away from lymphoma cancer. At the time, her mother was 29 years old. To help her cope with her mother’s death, her father enrolled her in theatrical therapy.&nbsp; Perhaps here is when she developed an interest in performing arts and improved her talents as an actor and performer in front of an audience.</p><p>Regarding her schooling, there is no formal record of her academic credentials or the college she attended. However, one might presume that she received some education in the journalism sector, as she is and has been for the majority of her professional career an investigative journalist.</p><h2>Professional Career of Lisa Guerrero:</h2><p>Lisa’s career has taken her to a variety of locations. She began her career as a cheerleader, then moved on to acting, journalism, and sportscasting, with a touch of modeling thrown in for good measure. Here, we go a little deeper into each of her several jobs over time.</p><p>In the 1980s, Lisa worked as a cheerleader. She was a Los Angeles Rams cheerleader. However, her talent enabled her to go from cheerleader to entertainment director. She previously worked for the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots as an Entertainment Director.</p><h2>Acting Career</h2><p>Lisa chose to try her hand at acting after working as an Entertainment Director for those two teams for a while. She began her acting career with a starring role in the television series In The Heat of the Night. She portrayed Maria Cystak in the show’s Night of the Killing episode from 1990.</p><p>Following that, she appeared as a Volunteer Bimbo in Matlock (TV series – 1991) and Batman Returns (Movie – 1992). This was her first important job. She then starred in Love Potion No. 9 (1992) and made a 1994 appearance on the popular television sitcom Seinfeld.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Guerrero-300x241.jpg><p>However, her most significant acting role was still to come. In 1998, she was cast as Francesca Vargas’s voice on the television sitcom Sunset Beach. Although it was a one-year voice acting gig (from 1998 to 1999), she voiced Francesca in 127 episodes.</p><p>According to IMDb, she has 17 acting credits, the most recent of which came in 2013 with the television miniseries Revenge of the Goblins.&nbsp;Lisa also has experience as a producer. In 2007, she and her partner Scott Erikson co-produced the independent film A Plumm Summer.</p><h3>Sportscasting Career</h3><p>Even before she was cast in Sunset Beach, she had already been working as a sports anchor. Lisa began her career as a sports anchor on Los Angeles’ KCBS-TV in 1997 and eventually relocated to KTTV. Then, in 1999, she was hired by Fox Network for another anchoring position.</p><p>She worked on a variety of shows during her time there, including Sports Geniuses, Fox Overtime, Fox Extra Innings, and the Toughman competition events. Additionally, she starred in a magazine-style television show for the San Diego Chargers. Lisa also co-hosted a single edition of The Best Damn Sports Show Period in 2001.</p><p>Lisa also had the opportunity to travel to Egypt and work in a field other than sports journalism. She was there when the special Opening the Tombs of the Golden Mummies was filmed. Lisa hosted Southern California Sports Report from 2000 to 2003. She made 210 appearances on the sports news show.</p><h6></h6><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Guerrero-Cheerleading-194x300.jpg><p>Following her tenure at Fox, she joined ABC to present NFL Monday Night Football. She did, however, participate in 17 episodes as a sideline reporter during her one season there, from 2003 to 2004. In 2006, she also hosted eight episodes of VH1’s game program World Series of Pop Culture.</p><p>Lisa joined CBS on July 15, 2006, as a member of Inside Edition, a television news magazine. She began as a correspondent and ultimately rose to the position of Chief Investigative Correspondent. According to IMDb, she has featured in 102 episodes of Inside Edition since joining, with one more appearance scheduled for Inside Edition Weekend in 2019.</p><h3>Journalism Honors</h3><p>She won the National Headliner Award for Best Investigative Report in 2011 for an undercover expose on air duct cleaning scams. Additionally, she has been nominated for a Prism Award for her piece on the hazards of drunkenness and boating, as well as a Genesis Award for her investigation into Florida’s horse slaughter farms.</p><h3>Modeling Career</h3><p>Lisa is not a professional model and has never been in her previous career. However, being THAT beautiful has a few advantages, one of which is that you do not have to be a professional model or learn to model in order to appear on magazine covers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Guerrero-Modeling-Career-300x259.jpg><p>This was precisely the situation, since Lisa became a model solely on the basis of her appearance and celebrity as a reporter, and a Playboy model at that. In the January 2006 issue of Playboy Magazine, she appeared topless.</p><p>And, perhaps as a compliment to her or a play on words from her 2001 The Best Damn Sports Show Period, the cover referred to her as The Best Damn Sports Beauty. Along with this prominent feature, she has appeared in a few other Playboy magazine issues and other publications.</p><h3>Author</h3><p>Writing a book is a footnote to the extensive list of accomplishments she has made throughout her career. Jewelry For Your Table, her sole book, was published in 2016. It’s a book about creating original works of art for the dining room table.</p><h2>Who is Lisa Guerrero’s husband?</h2><p>Lisa Guerrero married a professional athlete, which is unsurprising given her interest in and engagement with sports broadcasting. She married former Major League Baseball pitcher Scott Erickson. They married on February 3rd, 2004. Scott Gavin Erickson (full name) was a Major League Baseball player from 1990 to 2006.</p><p>He played with the Minnesota Twins from 1990 to 1995. He was then dealt to the Baltimore Orioles in 1995.&nbsp;It was during his tenure with the Orioles that his career began to deteriorate. Scott signed a minor league agreement with the New York Mets in 2004 after missing numerous seasons due to elbow and shoulder issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/live.staticflickr.com/4110/5059504846_fe0f2aa8df_b.jpg><p>However, the Mets dealt him to the Texas Rangers after just two starts. Then, in 2005, he was promoted to the Los Angeles Dodgers’ starting rotation. Scott signed another contract with the New York Yankees on the 16th of February 2006, but was released on the 19th of June. He announced his retirement from professional baseball at the start of the 2007 season.</p><p>Returning to their relationship, it is unclear whether they are married or not. According to her IMDb bio, they are divorced. Likewise, his Wikipedia entry indicates that they have divorced. However, we were unable to locate an official divorce date.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Body Measurements</h2><p>He is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) tall. That is a reasonable height for a former cheerleader and model, given her appearances on the covers of numerous magazines, including Playboy. Her physique, as well, must have aided her modeling career, as she boasts an outstanding 36-29-35-inch figure, according to Celebsfacts.com.</p><h2>The Social Media Presence of Lisa Guerrero</h2><p>Lisa Guerrero has a sizable social media following. She has around 62.5 thousand followers on her verified Twitter account. Similarly, her Instagram account, which has over 19 thousand followers, is similar. Her Facebook page, on the other hand, falls behind her Twitter and Instagram pages in terms of likes and followers. Her Facebook page has just over 6,900 likes and followers.</p><p><strong>you may also like </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Karla Zuniga</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKSZqK5us9SeqaudoqR8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-guerrero.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maria-gaspar-author-at-the-current-online.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maria-gaspar-author-at-the-current-online.html>Maria Gaspar, Author At The Current Online</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jean-knight-net-worth-2023-biography-age-family-religion-salary-income-assets.html>Jean Knight Net Worth 2023 : Biography, Age, Family, Religion, Salary, Income &amp;amp; Assets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jean-knight-net-worth-2023-biography-age-family-religion-salary-income-assets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
