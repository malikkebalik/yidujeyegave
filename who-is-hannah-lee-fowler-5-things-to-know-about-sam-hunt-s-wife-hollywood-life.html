The couple, who have been together on and off since 2008, are expecting another bundle of joy. An eyewitness at Sam’s April 21 concert in Las Vegas told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;that the singer made the announcement during the show. This news comes nearly one year after Sam and Hannah Lee <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their first child</a>, a daughter named&nbsp;<strong>Lucy</strong>, in May 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s been two years of major ups and downs for Sam and Hannah Lee, who split for a few months in 2022. Hannah Lee even filed for divorce at the time, but the pair was able to reconcile. Although these two have been together since 2008, their relationship has been on and off during that time. Learn more about the very private Hannah Lee and her relationship with Sam below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>How Did Sam Hunt Meet His Wife?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sam met Hannah Lee when they were both students at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. She grew up in Montevallo, Alabama, and he named his debut studio album about her. The songs on the record, which came out in 2014, were inspired by his relationship with Hannah Lee. The lyrics on&nbsp;Montevallo reference the ups and downs that Sam was going through with Hannah in the years leading up to its release, with many gut-wrenching breakup tracks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Of the album Sam told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>, “I didn’t actually live in that town. I had never visited Montevallo, but right before I left to go to Nashville, I met a girl from there. A lot of the experiences I had with her and the relationship I had with her inspired a lot of the songwriting of the album.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before putting out the album, Sam made sure to get Hannah Lee’s approval, though. “I spent a lot of time talking to her about the songs and asking, “What do you think about this?” Sam <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>explained</a> in 2015. “Her perspective as a powerful part of me being able to connect with a female audience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>By August 2016, Sam and Hannah Lee were seemingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back together</a>, but getting her back wasn’t easy. “I think [that summer] I went out [to Hawaii] about seven times in three months,” he shared in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2017 interview</a>. “Trying to talk her into coming back. And the seventh trip I convinced her.” In January 2017, Sam and Hannah Lee got engaged during a trip to Israel. They tied the knot just months later on April 15, 2017 in Georgia.</p><h2>Did Sam Hunt & Hannah Lee Fowler Get Divorced?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Sam and Hannah Lee are not divorce, but they came close. Issues plagued Sam and Hannah Lee’s relationship once again at the beginning of 2002 when she filed for divorce. Court documents, which were obtained by TMZ, revealed that Hannah Lee was pregnant with the pair’s first child at the time, and that she was asking for primary custody. She accused the singer of infidelity, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>By April 2022, Hannah Lee asked for the divorce case to be dismissed, which a judge signed off on. “They are back together,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a> reported at the time. “Sam is working on rebuilding his relationship with Hannah. They are both very focused on the baby’s arrival.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Does Sam Hunt Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sam Hunt and Hannah Lee welcomed their daughter, Lucy Lu, in May 2022, and he confirmed the news while performing at a concert the following month. “[Becoming a dad] has given me such a sense of purpose,” Sam gushed. “At home and out on the road. A new appreciation for life in general. I think I leveled up overnight, evolved 10 or 20 years overnight. Just staring at her, watching her grow little by little. Because when I leave, I realize how much she is growing. I’ve been really enjoying being around her and her mom and just experiencing the miracle of being a new dad.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>While the two are extremely private on social media, they did share a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>look at their baby</a> in a March 2023 video. Sam posted some family footage to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, giving fans the first glimpse of his little girl and a rare look at his private life.&nbsp; Hannah and Sam are expecting their second baby in 2023.</p><h2>Is Hannah Lee Fowler Still A Nurse?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Hannah Lee is a registered nurse. Although not much is known about her work life, Sam has opened up about his wife’s humanitarian efforts over the years. In 2009, she was providing medical care in Honduras, while also subsequently working at Syrian refugee camps and with Holocaust survivors in Israel.</p><h2>Hannah Lee Fowler’s Family</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Hannah is one of seven kids — she reportedly has three sisters, Sarah, Rebekah and Elizabeth, as well as three brothers named Jonathan, Joshua and Daniel. Hannah Lee is the oldets of her siblings. Hannah’s parents are Linda and Scott Fowler. Her dad is a pastor in the family’s hometown of Montevallo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K1orrNmp9mpJWaeqe71qWcq2WjlrputNSnq2avmZuybn6TaWhubWFk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hannah-lee-fowler-5-things-to-know-about-sam-hunt-s-wife-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-shou-zi-chew-the-tiktok-ceo-testifying-before-congress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-shou-zi-chew-the-tiktok-ceo-testifying-before-congress.html>Who is Shou Zi Chew, the TikTok CEO testifying before Congress?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-brady-robert-kraft-reunite-at-michael-rubin-s-hamptons-party.html>Tom Brady, Robert Kraft reunite at Michael Rubin's Hamptons party</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-brady-robert-kraft-reunite-at-michael-rubin-s-hamptons-party.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
