He passed away in 2011.</p><p>So how much is Clemons’ net worth? As of early 2017, based on authoritative it is reported to be $9.5 million acquired from his years working as a musician, including producing his own music and collaborating with various artists, and making appearances in various film and television.</p><h3>Clarence Clemons Net Worth $9.5 Million</h3><p>Clemons was born in Norfolk County, Virginia, into a family with two other siblings. His father was Clarence Clemons Sr., who worked as a fish market owner, and his mother Thelma – a homemaker. He was introduced into music at a very young age as his grandfather was a Southern Baptist who loved gospel music. When he was nine, Clemons’s father gave him a saxophone for Christmas, and his love affair with the instrument began. Soon he was playing with his high school band at Crestwood High School, but he also played football in high school that helped him gain a scholarship to college, later attending Maryland State College under a music and football scholarship. Although he was able to continue playing football in college, he suffered a car accident that prevented him from turning pro so he focused on music instead.</p><p>When he was 18, Clemons got his first studio experience recording with Tyrone Ashley’s Funky Music Machine. Soon, he joined his first band called The Vibratones, who he played with from 1961 to 1965. Simultaneously, he worked as counsellor at the Jamesburg Training School for Boys from 1962 until 1970, but his early years as a musician helped set up his career and also raise his net worth.</p><p>In 1971, Clemons’ world changed when he met <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>. Although there are various stories circling around on how they met, Clemons claimed that they met one night while <a href=#>Springsteen</a> was playing in Asbury Park. From there the two started playing together, and he became a permanent part of <a href=#>Springsteen’s</a> E Street Band until his death in 2011. Their long standing friendship helped elevate his career and tremendously raised his wealth.</p><p>Aside from working with <a href=#>Springsteen</a>, Clemons also had his own solo career, and released a total of seven albums. He worked with various other artists too, including <a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a>, <a href=#>Ringo Starr</a>, <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> and Aja Kim. He was also known for his appearances in various television shows and films, such as “New York, New York”, and “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure”. Other shows that he appeared in were “Human Target”, “The Simpsons”, “My Wife and Kids”, “The Wire” and “’Til Death”. His various projects as a solo artist all helped raise his net worth as well.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Clemons was married five times, lastly to Victoria in 2008 – he had five children. On 12 June 2011, Clemons suffered stroke, and six days later he passed away in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=37.751098556183><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Clarence Clemons</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$9.5 Million</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 11, 1942, Norfolk County, Virginia , U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>June 18, 2011, West Palm Beach, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 5" (1.96 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Saxophonist, musician, actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Crestwood High School, Maryland State College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Spouse</td><td>Victoria Clemons (m. 2008–2011, his death), Elizabeth Connell-Barr, Christina Clemons</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Clarence "Nick" Clemons III, Charles Clemons, Christopher Clemons, Jarod Clemons</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Clarence Clemons Sr., Thelma Clemons</td></tr><tr readability=0.28><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/clarenceclemons?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BTHnunEguBz/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166317</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23188405797101><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/clarence-clemons-mn0000782375</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Big Man of the Year Award (2009, Little Kids Rock organization)</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Truth and Soul Records</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Albums</td><td>Hero (1985), Live in Asbury Park (2002), Live in Asbury Park, Vol. 2 (2004), Peacemaker (1995), Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Music Groups</td><td>Tyrone Ashley's Funky Music Machine, The Vibratones, E Street Band</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (E Street Band, 2014)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>New York, New York (1977), Bruce Springsteen: Glory Days (1985), Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), Fatal Instinct (1993), Blues Brothers 2000 (1998), Lady Gaga: The Edge of Glory (2011)</td></tr><tr readability=18><td>TV Shows</td><td>Diff'rent Strokes (1985), Jake and the Fatman (1989), New York, New York, Bill, Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Human Target, Nash Bridges, The Simpsons (1999), My Wife and Kids (2003), The Wire (2004), The Edge of Glory (2011, music video), You're a Friend of Mine (1985, music video)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=9.7574893009986><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>I am not out to get laid every night, not looking for the bomb cocaine or weed.
