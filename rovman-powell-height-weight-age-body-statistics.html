His mother used to work several odd jobs to make ends meet and send him and his sister to school.</li><li>Due to financial constraints, in his childhood, he used to live in a house of 2 rooms that were made of iron sheets. For a while, in his youth, to help his mother financially, he used to work as a goat keeper.</li><li>In January 2015, he made his List A debut during the 2014–15 season of the Regional Super50 (the premier domestic one-day cricket competition in the West Indies). In that match, representing Combined Campuses and Colleges against&nbsp;Guyana, he produced an all-round performance – 3/20 with the ball and 31 runs with the bat – that won him the ‘Player of the Match’ award.</li><li>In the 2016-17 season of the Regional Super50, Rovman was instrumental in Jamaica’s run to the final. In the semi-final, against Trinidad and Tobago, he smoked 95 runs from just 45 balls (including 9 sixes and 6 fours) and then produced figures of 5/36 with the ball to absolutely blow the opposition away and pocket the ‘Player of the Match’ award.</li><li>In December 2018, he captained the West Indies for the first time in an international match. This was because the squad that was picked to face Bangladesh in that ODI series was weakened as several senior players were unavailable due to a mixture of contractual, commitment, and personal issues.</li><li>In October 2019, he was named the captain of Jamaica’s squad for the 2019–20 season of the Regional Super50. He was Jamaica’s leading run-scorer in the tournament, with 412 runs in just 8 matches.</li><li>In January 2022, in the 3rd match of a 5-match bilateral home T20I series against England, Rovman recorded the first century of his T20I career. His sensational knock of 107 runs from just 53 balls had propelled the West Indies to a humongous total of 224 runs which would prove to be enough for a 20-run victory and a vital 2-1 lead in the series which the West Indies would eventually convert into a 3–2 series win.</li><li>Before the start of this match though, Rovman found himself at the center of unwanted controversy when <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Odean Smith</a> was rotated out of the playing XI of the West Indian team after the 2nd match of the series in his favor. West Indies had lost that game, leaving the series tied at 1-1.</li><li>An anonymous voice note, allegedly recorded by a regional cricket commentator, had then made it to the Caribbean media. The note had alleged that Odean had been removed from the playing XI because of the inherent bias of the team’s management, referring to the decades-old cricketing rivalry between the island countries (Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua, Trinidad&Tobago, etc.) that constitute the West Indies.</li><li>Cricket West Indies (CWI), the governing body for cricket in the West Indies (a sporting confederation of over a dozen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and dependencies that once formed the British West Indies), as well as the team’s head coach Phil Simmons, had both come out with strongly-worded statements that condemned the note as a nefarious attempt to destroy the unity and harmony of the team, stating that the decision to replace Odean with Rovman for the 3rd match of the series was purely a cricketing one.</li><li>In December 2023, during the IPL 2024 auction, Rovman was bought by Rajasthan Royals (RR) for INR 7.40 crore.</li><p>Featured Image by Rovman Powell / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqumr6WRo3qxu9aeo6Vn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frovman-powell-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./travis-scott-rihanna-sex-he-s-better-than-chris-brown-in-bed-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./travis-scott-rihanna-sex-he-s-better-than-chris-brown-in-bed-hollywood-life.html>Travis Scott &amp;amp; Rihanna Sex Hes Better Than Chris Brown In Bed Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./randi-mahomes-wiki-height-boyfriend-career-net-worth.html>Randi Mahomes- Wiki, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./randi-mahomes-wiki-height-boyfriend-career-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
