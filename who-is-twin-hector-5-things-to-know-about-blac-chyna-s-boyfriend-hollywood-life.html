They had been rumored to be together for about two years, with Chyna originally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharing a snapshot with him (and then quickly deleting it)</a> in Dec. 2020. Then, in 2021, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her mother,<strong> Tokyo Toni</strong></a>, confirmed they are indeed in a relationship. “She’s with Lil Twin. They’ve been together about two years or so now,” she told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Sun</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Twin Hector, however, seems to have confirmed their relationship back in Oct. 2021 with a photo of himself grabbing onto her bodacious bottom, which can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. So, who is the man who has the key to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of two</a>‘s heart? Read on to learn about rapper Twin Hector.</p><h2>1. Twin Hector Is A Rapper And Fashion Designer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Twin Hector is a rapper who featured Blac Chyna in his 2021 video, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Woman’s Worth”</a>. The video has more than 200,000 views and has generally supportive comments under it about both Chyna and Twin Hector. He has 5,200 monthly listeners on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spotify</a> as of this writing and his top songs include “Assignment”, “All Into It”, and “Ok Look”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> also lists him as a fashion designer, and he has a section that sells his line, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SCHIZO</a>. His offerings include t-shirts, shorts, and tracksuits. His tees are printed with a variety of quotes, such as “The Crazy Cousin” and<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “Prioritize Your Mental”</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“A man of many hats, Hector is putting his creativity and brand first,” his website boasts. “From music to fashion, he delivers high quality results with a keen sense of detail.”</p><h2>2. Blac Chyna And Twin Hector Were Rumored To Be Engaged</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2021, a celebrity hairstylist named <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jay&nbsp;</strong></a>claimed that Chyna had booked him for her “upcoming wedding”, as you can see by the below screenshot. While his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> shows that he has worked with the reality star, the wedding never seemed to happen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Plus, Chyna’s mom told The Sun that she was unaware of an engagement at the time. “Today was my first-time hearing about it. I’m shocked,” she said. She also confirmed that her daughter was not expecting a child. Chyna shares her daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dream</strong></a>, 6, with ex-fiancé <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rob Kardashian</strong></a>, and her 10-year-old son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>King Cairo</strong></a>, with rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyga</strong></a>.</p><h2>3. Twin Hector Likes To Show Off His Money</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Money seems to be no problem for Twin Hector. As seen above, in 2022, he created a stick figure person with $50 bills and proudly posed on the ground next to it. Later in the year, he held a thick stack of $20 bills on his shoulder. The stack was so high that it reached above his head. He’s also posted with luxury cars several times and even gloated that he “Came home 2 Lamb Chop for Dinner..” in Aug. 2021 as he laid across a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white Lamborghini</a>.</p><h2>4. Twin Hector Loves Playing Basketball</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>While fashion and music seem to be the passions that make him money, Twin Hector also has another passion: basketball. His <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> feed is scattered with footage of him <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>playing the spprt</a>. Plus, during the early morning hours of Jan. 30, 2023, he posted an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram Story</a> from Los Angeles and asked if anyone was around to shoot some hoops. Now that’s dedication!</p><h2>5. Tattoos Cover Twin Hector’s Torso</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Like several other famous musicians, such as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> or <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, Twin Hector’s torso and arms are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>covered by tattoos</a>, as seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. Some of his tattoos include “Madonna” on his right chest and “Twin” on his left chest. He also has a swear word written on the side of his left chest, a bird flying on his upper left chest, and a spiderweb on his right arm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBuLXNZp%2Bem6Skv26Bj2pvamtmZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-twin-hector-5-things-to-know-about-blac-chyna-s-boyfriend-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaron-mellette.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaron-mellette.html>Aaron Mellette</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vanessa-guill%C3%A9n-cousin-wiki-death-parents-net-worth.html>Vanessa Guilln Cousin, Wiki, Death, Parents, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vanessa-guill%C3%A9n-cousin-wiki-death-parents-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
