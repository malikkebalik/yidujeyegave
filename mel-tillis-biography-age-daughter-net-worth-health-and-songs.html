He was born on 8 August 1932 in Tampa, Florida, USA.</strong><span id=more-896></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He contracted malaria when aged only three, and was left with a permanent stutter. During his school days, various treatments failed to cure this speech problem and though originally embarrassed by it, he managed in later years to turn it into a trademark. He learned to play guitar (and later the fiddle) during his early teens and at high school was a football player and also played drums in a band. In the early 50s, devoid of any real career ideas, he enlisted in the Air Force. He was discharged in 1955 when for a short time he attended the University of Florida.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Mel Tillis Age</h2><p>He was born on 8 August 1932.</p><h2>Mel Tillis Net Worth</h2><p>He has an estimated net worth of $20 million.</p><h2>Mel Tillis Daughters – Mel Tillis Family</h2><p>Mel Tillis’ Daughters include; <a href=#>Pam Tillis</a>, Hannah Tillis, Carrie April Tillis, and Cindy Tillis.

The information hasn’t flowed easily and we’ve been fiercely private about many of the details of his illness. Offstage, we are not particularly suited to the social media era. There were some very tough months with Dad’s illness. Our total focus was paying attention to him and his recovery; press announcements were not a priority. Thanks for your patience and understanding if you have felt in the dark on his well being.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>So, that being said here is the latest:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As many of you already know, Dad had a serious diverticulitis attack last January after a busy fall 2015 performance schedule. On the way to the hospital, he became septic and was in the I.C.U. for the better part of a month. Everything he is dealing with now, almost a year later, is a direct result of that crisis. Due to the nature of his illness, his care was best served in several facilities in Nashville up until November.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/informationcradle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Mel-Tillis-Photo.jpg><p>Currently, he is at home in Ocala, Florida receiving full-time in-house care. His transition, initially, involved a few more weeks in the hospital there. Now, he’s back at home and on track. His vital signs are good and his sense of humor is fully intact! There are no foreseeable personal appearances, as of now. He misses his fans as much as they miss him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I miss performing with him very much, particularly at Christmas as I reminisce about all the family Christmas shows we did over the years. I play his music as people walk into my own concerts.<br>That is the long and short of it for now. We will try to do better on updates. Keep him in your prayers. They have worked.
