<time>05 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/astrology-fire-signs-1-copy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The <a href=#>Zodiac Wheel</a>, like the Earth itself, is composed of four distinct elements; fire, earth, air and <a href=#>water</a>. Within the element of fire, we find the signs <a href=#>Aries</a>, <a href=#>Leo</a> and <a href=#>Sagittarius</a>. While all fire signs possess their own individual strengths and challenges, their ruling element lends common infernal energy.&nbsp;</p><p>In his seminal play “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Aries author <a href=#>Tennessee Williams </a>writes: “The opposite of death is desire.” Within that simple truth lies the impetus for action and expression among fire signs. Wanting is what makes them feel most alive, and winning is what urges them forward at an impassioned and, at times, reckless pace.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, patience is their least-marked virtue. The accelerated approach of fire signs makes them equal parts exciting and brash. Yet what they lack in reason they more than make up for in enthusiasm and loyalty. These folks get fired up for a cause and are fiercely — and often aggressively — protective of those they hold dear.</p><p>There is no element more prone to destruction or formation than fire. If the energy of this element is considered, conducted and thoughtfully applied — a controlled burn if you will — there is nothing more powerful. Fire can forge metal, cook meat, keep you warm in winter or burn your damn house down. Meditation and the practice of counting to 10 can be especially beneficial for fire signs, as it helps them keep their emotions and emotional outbursts in check.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fire signs in love</strong></h2><p>In love, the bold nature of fire finds a lovely place to burn. As their element implies, these folks have zero chill and loathe nothing more than wasting time. Fittingly, they’re not the type to play coy or cool or wait three days to text back. If a fire sign is into you, you’ll know it, as they won’t shy away from making the first move — and every other move thereafter. Naturally autonomous, fire signs do not require constant validation from their partners and prefer to have interests and activities apart from their primary relationship. There is less danger of codependent tendencies developing when fire signs are in the mix, and potential partners will be drawn to the inherent warmth, confidence and spontaneity these folks bring.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a restless, childlike energy to fire signs. In a relationship, that can translate at its best and brightest expression as a state of constant play in which love seems like a grand adventure. On a bad day, it’s akin to dating a petulant child who makes you feel like a stodgy bore for not wanting to stay up until dawn or drive across three states to buy contraband fireworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You won’t have to guess what a direct and honest fire sign is thinking, and they don’t expect you to psychically sense it like, ahem, <a href=#>water signs</a>. Ever the enthusiast, fire signs — and Aries in particular — tend to fall in love at an alarming speed but run the risk of falling out of it just as quickly. In conflict, fire signs are quick to temper but also quick to temperance; they forgive easily and avoid the emotional investment that holding a grudge (the preferred cardio of Earth signs) requires.</p><p>The frankness of fire energy easily and beautifully translates into sexuality. Fire signs are able to give their partners honest feedback and inspire them to be more open about their own wants. Consequently, <a href=#>Lil Nas X</a> and <a href=#>Madonna</a> — two artists who push the boundaries of, and incite conversation around, sexuality — are both fire signs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Fire-fave Lil Nas X offers up a steamy performance at the 2021 BET Awards. <span class=credit>Getty Images for BET</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fire signs at work&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Fire signs thrive when they are oxygenated by a varied and fast-paced work environment. They require constant challenge and are more than capable of working independently and diligently. Fire signs are built for careers where adrenaline runs high, including — but not limited to — fire rescue. They are resistant to routine, static work environments and authoritative regimes that make no room for their often inspired suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>Fire signs are ever-seeking avenues for expression and active exchange. They need a clear and present goal or directive to apply their formidable energy toward. At their highest capacity, fire signs energize their work environments, galvanizing others to accelerate and achieve through their positive attitude and direct approach to challenges. On the shadow side, fire signs are guilty of showboating, impatience and unbecoming outbursts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ideal careers for fire signs: </strong>professional gambler, animal trainer, storm chaser, reporter, ER doctor, flight attendant, sports announcer&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fire and fire signs&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Guaranteed to generate heat, fire-fire combos have legendary chemistry that can turn caustic when conflict arises. <a href=#>Double Leos Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez</a> are doing their part to prove the power of love on fire.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fire and Earth signs</strong></h2><p>Fire inspires Earth to pick up the pace and appreciate a quickie in a gas station bathroom. Earth reminds fire to slow down long enough to appreciate a long walk and a well-laid plan.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Fire and air signs</strong></h2><p>Fire is fed by air and this pair can go for miles with their well-matched intellect. Fire will never tire of the quick wit and curiosity of air, while fire teaches air to bring ideas into action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fire and water signs&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Water invites fire to chill their tits long enough to respond rather than react. Fire teaches Water that feelings can be fuel.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Ruler: </strong>Mars</p><p><strong>Quality: </strong><a href=#>Cardinal</a></p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Ram<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aries is the zodiac’s first sign — the proverbial id. This firstborn rabble-rouser arrives on the scene ready to be seen. Aries is ruled by Mars, the jock planet of sex, aggression, ambition, scoreboards and high-fives. These folks love a physical challenge and a carnal conquest. They are naturally impatient and at times their communication style can border on tactless. They are rarely trying to be offensive — only efficient. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cue “Cherry Bomb” by The Runaways.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The temper of the Aries ilk is notable for both its intensity and its short life span exemplified, by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney ‘not afraid to use a water bottle as a weapon’ Kardashian</a>. As a Cardinal sign, Aries heralds the start of a new season. Fittingly, Aries energy is fiercely proactive: fast as they can and forward at all costs. That trailblazing spirit easily extends to the realm of fashion, where there is no fear of being extra. Case in point: monogrammed couture robe-rocking <a href=#>Elton John</a>, Ms. separate-closet-for-my-lingerie <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> and <a href=#>Lady Gaga every time she leaves the house.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mariah Carey is all about adding fire to fashion. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MC</span></figure><p><strong>Ruler: </strong>Sun</p><p><strong>Quality: </strong><a href=#>Fixed</a></p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>Lion<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ruled by the brightest star — the sun itself — Leo is the most regal and decidedly shiniest of the fire signs. These natives live for luxury and are easily swayed by romance and good lighting. They get a bad rap for being self-centered and — while they do love the spotlight — they are more than willing to share the stage so long as they play lead, a fact exhibited by apex lion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mick Jagger</a>. When it comes to interpersonal relationships, Leos make for extremely loving, impossibly loyal and endlessly generous allies, at their best when in defense or support of others.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mick Jagger, from left, Steve Jordan and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones perform during their “No Filter” tour. <span class=credit>Amy Harris/Invision/AP</span></figure><p>Creative, confident and unafraid to stand apart from the crowd, Leo’s energy is made manifest in scrunchie-wearing<a href=#>, pretty in pink Lion King Jason Momoa</a>. As a fixed fire sign, Leos can be obstinate and controlling, often struggling to accept blame or responsibility. When you recognize yourself as the supreme ruler of all things, shame is easy to shrug off. Yet what they lack in humility, they easily make up for in heart. Symbolized by the brave and noble lion, these folks make for protective parents and affectionate partners. Physical touch is the uncontested love language of the Leo ilk, and natives are always game for a public makeout — looking at you, <a href=#>Sean Mendes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ruler: </strong>Jupiter</p><p><strong>Quality: </strong><a href=#>Mutable</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Symbol: </strong>the Archer&nbsp;</p><p>Ruled by Jupiter, planet of luck and expansion, there is a swashbuckling, dice-throwing, let-the-good-times-roll energy to Sagittarius. The eternal optimist of the zodiac, these folks don’t subscribe to limits, often pushing beyond their own to varying degrees of success. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cue Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping.”</a>&nbsp;</p><p>As a mutable sign, Sagittarius is a touch more go-with-the-flow and open to collaboration than Aries and Leo, but no less active or empowered. Ever on the move and moving toward the new, Sagittarians are quick to start but often struggle to sustain the focus and momentum necessary to complete their myriad passion projects. Constructively channeled, Sagittarius energy has the capacity not just to fulfill dreams but to build empires, as exemplified by archer/mogul <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay-Z</a>.</p><p>The most difficult choice a Sagittarius faces is “truth or dare.” These folks live for the thrill of the hunt and the metallic sound of brutal honesty landing on unsuspecting ears. Yet their indomitable, sunny-side-up perspective makes them invaluable leaders of the hype squad. We keep them around because they’re always ready to go and rarely say, “No” — preferring to ask, “Why not?”</p><p>Astrologer <a href=#>Reda Wigle</a> researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign. Her horoscopes integrate history, poetry, pop culture and personal experience. She is also an accomplished writer who has profiled a variety of artists and performers, as well as extensively chronicled her experiences while traveling. Among the many intriguing topics she has tackled are cemetery etiquette, her love for dive bars, Cuban Airbnbs, a “girls guide” to strip clubs and the “weirdest” foods available abroad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mn6Gimnq0tcanqmayn5m2oq%2BMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2funderstanding-fire-signs-aries-leo-sagittarius.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-lily-cowles-s-age-know-about-her-bio-wiki-height-net-worth-parents-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-lily-cowles-s-age-know-about-her-bio-wiki-height-net-worth-parents-family.html>What Is Lily Cowles's Age?
