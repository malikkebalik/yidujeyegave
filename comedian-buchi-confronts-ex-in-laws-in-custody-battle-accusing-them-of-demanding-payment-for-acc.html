Moreover, they have decreased his communication with his daughter from twice a week to just one video call and even voice note. He also claimed that they consistently block him after each call until he gives in to their demands.</p><p>Furthermore, in a separate post, he expressed his weariness with being strong but emphasized that he would not stop fighting for his children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/You-asked-me-to-pay-to-have-access-to-my-1024x683.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/They-asked-me-to-pay-before-having-access-to-my-daughter-Comedian-Buchi-calls-out-his-estranged-inla.jpeg><p>Many offered their support in the comments, questioning why some women use their children as leverage against their estranged partners.</p><p>One commenter, Vee Vogee, added a reminder to consider marrying into a good family when seeking a spouse.</p><p>A commenter, Jojo Store, expressed confusion over parents depriving fathers of access to their children following separation, despite the fathers’ ongoing support for the children.</p><p>While The Victorious Chisom conveyed dismay over children becoming victims of their parents’ disputes, another commenter, Mr. Btm, urged men to speak out instead of suffering in silence. Joan Odenu also praised men for taking an active role in their children’s lives following separation.</p><p>A few months ago, Buchi accused his estranged wife’s family of orchestrating the abduction of their children and denying him access to them. He reiterated that they could prevent him from speaking to the children but couldn’t evade the law, issuing a warning for them to grant him access.</p><p>Buchi and his wife tied the knot in 2017 and have two children together. Their marriage encountered turmoil last year due to reported violent behavior from his wife. In a related case, Nigerian radio host Do2dtun also lamented his inability to see his children following his separation from his wife. She filed for separation after almost nine years of marriage, citing forced abortion, domestic violence, and emotional abuse. Do2dtun expressed his longing for his children on his Instagram page, revealing that it had been 10 months since he last saw them.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaqKWVmbaiuoybrJygmWKwsLrFq6anrKNisrl5yKdkpZmnqHqquoycrKysn5nGbq7AraulnV2WsKTB0qKloGWknbKuec6fZJ2dnZa7pbXNoGSpmamisq%2FAjJ%2Bmq2WRmLCmv9Jmq6hlmJ7AbrDArp6hrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcomedian-buchi-confronts-ex-in-laws-in-custody-battle-accusing-them-of-demanding-payment-for-acc.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dakota-chapman-meet-eldest-son-of-leland-chapman-and-his-girlfriend-raina.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dakota-chapman-meet-eldest-son-of-leland-chapman-and-his-girlfriend-raina.html>Dakota Chapman- Meet Eldest Son Of Leland Chapman and His Girlfriend, Raina</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./abduba-dida-paid-sh1-000-as-my-dowry-is-cruel-and-calls-me-a-prostitute-wife.html>Abduba Dida Paid Sh1,000 As My Dowry, Is Cruel And Calls Me A Prostitute - Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./abduba-dida-paid-sh1-000-as-my-dowry-is-cruel-and-calls-me-a-prostitute-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
