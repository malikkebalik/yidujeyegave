<time>09 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH: Tim Ballard, the renowned anti-child slavery activist and founder of Operation Underground Railroad (OUR), is married to the love of his life, Katherine Ballard, and the pair have nine children.</p><p>Ballard, whose work was depicted in the movie 'Sound of Freedom,' has been a prominent figure in the fight against child trafficking and exploitation. However, recent allegations have cast a shadow over his legacy and future endeavors.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>The rise and fall of Tim Ballard: Warrior activist's story went viral with 'Sound of Freedom' now even his church has erased him</a></p><p>Ballard, a former advisor to the Trump administration on child sexual trafficking, abruptly resigned from OUR in June, leaving supporters and colleagues in the dark about the reasons behind his departure.</p><h2 class=split>Allegations against Tim Ballard</h2><p>However, online media outlet <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vice</a> reported on Monday, September 18, that Ballard's resignation was prompted by an internal investigation launched by OUR into allegations of sexual misconduct involving at least seven women.</p><p>According to Vice's report, Ballard had allegedly invited female staff and volunteers to accompany him on overseas missions, often playing the role of his wife. He would then reportedly coerce them into sharing his bed or showering together by convincing them that such actions were necessary to deceive human traffickers.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Paul Hutchinson? ‘Sound of Freedom’ producer accused of groping possibly underage trafficking victim’s breasts</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/38619d37-fb5c-4fec-9ca9-95072c0a7c51.1503697468><p>Several women interviewed by Vice shared their experiences, including one who received photographs of Ballard in his underwear with fake tattoos and another who was asked how far she was willing to go to save enslaved children.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Tim Ballard scandal: YouTube video poses searching questions as anti-trafficking crusader forced out of OUR</a></p><p>In response to these allegations, OUR issued a statement confirming that Tim Ballard had been "permanently separated" from the organization he founded in 2013.</p><p>However, the statement did not comment on the specific allegations, only stating that OUR "does not tolerate sexual harassment or discrimination within its organization." They also mentioned that an independent law firm was conducting a comprehensive investigation into the allegations.</p><h2 class=split>Tim Ballard controversy</h2><p>Ballard, who had previously investigated child sexual trafficking as a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), gained widespread recognition when his work was portrayed in the movie 'Sound of Freedom.'</p><p>However, the film garnered mixed reviews and was described by some critics as "QAnon adjacent" and "Maga-friendly," due to its perceived alignment with certain political ideologies.</p><p>The controversy surrounding Ballard's resignation extended beyond the allegations of sexual harassment. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) issued a condemnation of Ballard, stating that it was "morally unacceptable" to use the name of the church's president, M Russell Ballard, to promote personal and financial interests.</p><p>While the two Ballards were not related, they had formed a friendship that ended with Tim Ballard's actions, which LDS deemed a betrayal of their trust.</p><p>Tim Ballard vehemently denied the church's claims and expressed his deep respect for President Ballard. He insisted that he had never used President Ballard's name for personal gain and questioned the veracity of the church's statement.</p><h2 class=split>Tim Ballard wife</h2><p>Amidst this controversy, one aspect of Tim Ballard's life that has been less explored is his relationship with his wife, Katherine Ballard.</p><p>In the movie 'Sound of Freedom,' Katherine Ballard is portrayed by actress Mira Sorvino as a supportive figure who stands by her husband's efforts to combat sex trafficking in Colombia. The Ballards have been married for over two decades and have a family of nine, including two children they adopted following a sting operation in Haiti.</p><p>Despite Tim Ballard's public profile, the early chapters of their love story remain somewhat mysterious. The Operation Underground Railroad's website features a dedicated page to Katherine Ballard.</p><p>“She is his sounding board, spiritual guru and biggest supporter avows Tim Ballard, Founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad. He’s talking about the love of his life, Katherine Ballard, without whom he would not have started O.U.R.,” the page reads.&nbsp;</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Who is Fabian Marta?
