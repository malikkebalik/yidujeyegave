The martial artist, actor, producer, and musician has been in the entertainment industry for over three decades, starring in dozens of films and TV shows. He is best known for his roles in movies such as Under Siege, Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, and Above the Law. But how much is Steven Seagal worth in 2023? And what are the sources of his income and expenses? In this article, we will explore the net worth of Steven Seagal and how he made his fortune.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Steven Seagal’s Early Life and Career</strong></h2><p>Steven Seagal was born on April 10, 1952, in Lansing, Michigan. His father was a high school math teacher and his mother was a medical technician. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants and his mother had Irish, German, and Dutch ancestry. Seagal began his martial arts training at the age of seven, learning karate from Fumio Demura. He later moved to Japan to study aikido, where he became a 7th-dan black belt and an instructor. He also learned other martial arts such as judo, kendo, and kenjutsu.</p><p>Seagal moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s, where he opened his own dojo and taught aikido to celebrities and wealthy clients. One of his students was Michael Ovitz, a powerful Hollywood agent who helped Seagal land his first movie role in Above the Law (1988). The film was a success and launched Seagal’s career as an action star. He followed it up with more hits such as Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), Out for Justice (1991), and Under Siege (1992), which was his highest-grossing film to date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Steven Seagal’s Peak and Decline</strong></h2><p>In the mid-1990s, Seagal was one of the most popular and highest-paid actors in Hollywood. He earned $20 million for The Glimmer Man (1996) and $15 million for On Deadly Ground (1994), which he also directed. He also ventured into producing and writing, creating films such as Fire Down Below (1997) and The Patriot (1998). However, his career began to decline in the late 1990s, as his films received poor reviews and box office returns. He also faced legal troubles, such as lawsuits from former employees and business partners, allegations of sexual harassment and assault from several women, and tax evasion charges.</p><p>Seagal’s career shifted to mostly direct-to-video productions in the 2000s and 2010s. He starred in low-budget films such as Black Dawn (2005), Urban Justice (2007), Driven to Kill (2009), Sniper: Special Ops (2016), and Beyond the Law (2019). He also appeared in reality shows such as Steven Seagal: Lawman, which followed his activities as a reserve deputy sheriff in Louisiana and Arizona, and Steven Seagal: True Justice, which featured him as a leader of an undercover team of cops. He also made cameo appearances in films such as Machete (2010) and Gutshot Straight (2014).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Steven Seagal’s Net Worth in 2023</strong></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Steven Seagal’s net worth is estimated to be $14 million as of August 2023. This is a significant drop from his peak net worth of $100 million in the mid-1990s2. His net worth has been affected by several factors, such as his declining popularity, legal fees, taxes, alimony payments, bad investments, and lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Seagal has been married four times and has seven children. His first wife was Miyako Fujitani, a Japanese martial artist whom he married in 1975 and divorced in 1986. They have two children: Kentaro Seagal an actor and musician, and Ayako Fujitani &nbsp;an actress and writer. His second wife was Adrienne La Russa an actress whom he married in 1984 but annulled the same year due to his marriage with Fujitani not being legally dissolved. His third wife was Kelly LeBrock, a model and actress whom he married in 1987 and divorced in 1996. They have three children: Annaliza Seagal, Dominic Seagal, and Arissa LeBrock &nbsp;who are all models. His fourth wife is Erdenetuya Batsukh , a Mongolian dancer whom he married in 2009. They have one son: Kunzang Seagal.</p><p>Seagal owns several properties around the world, including a ranch in Colorado, a mansion in Louisiana, a villa in Italy, and a house in Arizona. He also has a collection of cars, motorcycles, guitars, swords, and guns. He is an avid supporter of environmental and animal rights causes, as well as a follower of Buddhism and a friend of the Dalai Lama. He is also a fan of Vladimir Putin and has been granted Russian and Serbian citizenships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Steven Seagal is a legendary action star who has entertained millions of fans with his martial arts skills and charisma.
