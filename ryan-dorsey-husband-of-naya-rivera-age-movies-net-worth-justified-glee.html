And, apparently, what a lot of people do not know is the fact that Ryan dated Naya years before they tied the knot. Here’s what you need to know about him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ryan Dorsey Dated Naya Rivera Before Big Sean</h3><p>Actor Ryan Dorsey and his former spouse Naya Rivera surprised everyone in July 2014 when they walked down the aisle just a few months later they began dating. However, there’s more to the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/36a776b85ad0014bb173e5ee6ab757e8_450x.jpg><p>Rivera is known for dating rapper <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Sean</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tahj Mowry</a></strong>, and her Glee co-star, <strong>Mark Salling</strong>. The actress only dated the rapper who she was also engaged to in 2013, but they ended their short-lived romance in 2014.</p><p>Ryan, however, had already been in Rivera’s life before the actress met Big Sean. But, their relationship didn’t last until they rekindled their romance in 2014. Dorsey and Rivera tied the knot in Mexico.</p><p>Their first and only child, a son named <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josey Hollis Dorsey</a></strong> was born in September 2015. But, two years later, the husband and wife split as Rivera filed for divorce in 2016. It was also reported that the actress was arrested after she hit Ryan in the head. But, he later claimed on never being hurt in January 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EchveyCXkAMmUnN_450x.jpg><p>The divorce was finally finalized in June 2018 after two years of battling for the custody of their son. As per the custody of Josey, Ryan and Naya agreed to share it equally.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Death of Dorsey’s Former Wife</h3><p>In July 2020, news surfaced that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naya Rivera went missing</a> along with their son, Josey Hollis Dorsey in Lake Piru which is notorious for being dangerous.
