He has been involved in multiple disturbing issues with his former partners and their babies.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The musician refused to acknowledge his son from his ex girlfriend, Alexis Adams. This put his baby mama and the child in a precarious position. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Flo Rida Refused to Acknowledge His Son</h2><p>In 2017, reports started surfacing&nbsp;about Flo Rida's relationship with Adams and their son, Zohar Paxton.</p><p>In the initial reports that came out, it was revealed that Flo Rida and Adams first hooked up in 2015. They had a casual relationship, nothing serious.</p><p><img alt="Flo Rida's baby mama Alexis Adams claims the musician has never seen or acknowledged their son, Zohar Paxton." height=417 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Flo-rida-son-baby-mama.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Flo Rida's baby mama Alexis Adams claims the musician has never seen or acknowledged their son, Zohar Paxton.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BCKOnline</a>/Alexis Adams/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The relationship went on until, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her own words</a>, she&nbsp;"discovered [she]&nbsp;was pregnant" in 2016.</p><p>After finding this out, Flo Rida insinuated he wanted her to abort the baby. He told her he was not ready for it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After this, he even sent her messages, calling Zohar <a href=# rel="follow noopener">horrible things</a>. And he did not acknowledge Zohar to be his child.</p><p>Amidst this, Adams had another problem to deal with. Zohar was born with Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition that causes excess fluid build-up in the brain.</p><p>Therefore, for financial help, she started reaching out to Flo Rida. But he did not respond. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This forced Adams to take legal action â€” she took him to court in early 2017 for ignoring child support. At the time, the only time Flo Rida and Zohar had been in the same room was when he had to take a paternity test.</p><p>The test result&nbsp;was&nbsp;one of the bases for her to sue him. The test suggested a 99.99 percent chance Flo Rida was Zohar's father.</p><p>In her filings, Adams requested child support, mainly because she was struggling to cover her son's medical bills.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Flo Rida came back with a response to this, saying he was already paying her five thousand dollars a month and that she was being greedy asking for more money.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The musician was yet to see or acknowledge his son&nbsp;as of October 2020. Adams put up a video with Zohar that month and revealed that he was also on the spectrum.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a> with Shawn Allen, she also mentioned how his legal team used the term "allegedly" when describing Zohar as his son,&nbsp;when he was approached about the subject by <a href=# rel=follow>Wendy Williams</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Not Flo Rida's First Time</h2><p>As it would come out after this case, this was not the first time Flo Rida had ignored his child. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Williams revealed that before this, Flo Rida had gone through a similar situation in 2015.</p><p>In that case, too, he did not acknowledge that the child was his and reached a court settlement for child support payments later on.</p><p>As for Zohar, he is growing up well. By 2019, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">understood the world</a> through art and music and was already giving back to the Autism community. He had raised $10 thousand for Autism research that year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6cpHqztcOaZKynnmO1tbnL</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflo-rida-s-baby-mama-says-he-refuses-to-see-his-son.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jill-biden-s-white-house-christmas-decorations-2022-photos-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jill-biden-s-white-house-christmas-decorations-2022-photos-hollywood-life.html>Jill Bidens White House Christmas Decorations 2022: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daniil-medvedev-tennis-career-wife-ranking-net-worth.html>Daniil Medvedev Tennis Career, Wife, Ranking, Net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daniil-medvedev-tennis-career-wife-ranking-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
