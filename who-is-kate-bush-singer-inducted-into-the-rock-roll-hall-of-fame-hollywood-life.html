This induction follows a return to the mainstream, thanks to Stranger Things 4. Kate’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” is featured heavily in the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fourth season</a>, and it definitely got stuck in a few people’s heads. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The 1985 single</a> climbed to the number one slot on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>iTunes charts</a>&nbsp;and topped the charts again in her native U.K. In the U.S. the song reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The popularity was due to so many fans either finding it for the first time or re-discovering the classic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ahead of the ceremony — taking place on Nov. 3, 2023, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY — find out everything you need to know about her here!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kate-bush-5-things-stranger-things-embed1.jpg><h2>Kate Dropped Her Debut Album In 1978.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While “Running Up That Hill” didn’t come out until 1985, Kate started her career much earlier! When Kate was a teen, her family helped her produce a demo, which got into the hands of Pink Floyd guitarist&nbsp;<strong>David Gilmour,&nbsp;</strong>who helped her get a record deal. “He was really responsible for me getting my recording contract with EMI in the first place,” Kate said in the past, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Far Out Magazine</a>.&nbsp;Kate made her debut in 1978 with&nbsp;The Kick Inside, which included the classic “Wuthering Heights,” and she quickly followed it up with&nbsp;Lionheart,&nbsp;later that same year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Now over 40 years later, Kate has 10 albums under her belt, with her most recent being 2011’s&nbsp;50 Words For Snow. Similar to her debut, her most recent two albums were both released in 2011, with her dropping&nbsp;Director’s Cut&nbsp;earlier in the year.</p><h2>She’s Performed With Fellow Music Legends.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Kate famously began her career with David Gilmour, she’s had plenty of other classic rock icons that she’s gotten a chance to play with. Her 1993 album&nbsp;The Red Shoes&nbsp;featured contributions from rock royalty like&nbsp;<strong>Prince, Jeff Beck, </strong>and <strong>Eric Clapton.</strong> <strong>Elton John </strong>also provided guest vocals for 2011’s “Snowed In At Wheeler Street.”&nbsp;Of course, David has also lent his guitar skills for her 1989 songs “Love and Anger” and “Rocket’s Tail.”</p><h2>Her Husband Plays Guitar With Her.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 1992, Kate married&nbsp;<strong>Dan McIntosh,&nbsp;</strong>and it’s clear the two have a creative bond as well as a romantic one. Dan made his earliest contributions to Kate’s 1993 album&nbsp;The Red Shoes, and he’s played guitar on each of Kate’s albums since then. He was also a member of the 70s group Bandit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kate-bush-5-things-stranger-things-embed2.jpg><h2>“Running Up That Hill” Was On The&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Charts For 20 Weeks In 1985.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>While “Running Up That Hill” has found a new audience and a resurgence in popularity due to&nbsp;Stranger Things, it was also a massive hit when it was first released. The song peaked at number 30 on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard Hot 100</a> charts in 1985. It stayed on the charts from early September of that year, until the end of November. The song was also Kate’s highest-charting track on the Hot 100 charts.</p><h2>She Took A 35-Year Hiatus From Touring.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kate-bush-5-things-stranger-things-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>While it’s commonplace for artists to hit the road after each album release, Kate has notoriously avoided live performances for much of her career. After her first two albums came out in 1978, she embarked on a series of dates throughout Europe called “The Tour of Life” in 1979. After that, she stopped touring for a very long time, aside from occasional one-off appearances. She returned to the stage once more in 2014 for a residency at London’s Hammersmith Apollo, called “Before The Dawn.” She opened up about what it was like to get back out there in a 2016 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Independent.</a>&nbsp;“I was very nervous about going onstage and performing. But the response was just beyond anything I could have wished for, every night, the audiences were so excited and so responsive,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Other than being “nervous” for her comeback performance, Kate also explained that she had planned to tour more, but became much more involved in the visual aspects of a record. “The plan at the time was that I was going to do another two albums’ worth of fresh material, and then do another show. But of course, by the time I got to the end of what was&nbsp;The Dreaming album, it had gone off on a slight tilt, because I’d become so much more involved in the recording process,” she told&nbsp;The Independent.&nbsp;“So I started to veer away from the thing of being a live performing artist, to one of being a recording artist with attached visuals.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K4osDEZpmuq5higXiBkXBnamc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kate-bush-singer-inducted-into-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-meghan-markle-attend-the-met-gala-2023-prince-harry-coronation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-meghan-markle-attend-the-met-gala-2023-prince-harry-coronation.html>Will Meghan Markle Attend the Met Gala 2023?
